# Publicis Sapient 2022 Internship - Team 4

Demonstration Information

## Pre-Recorded Demonstration

If you'd like to see a pre-recorded demonstration of our application, check it out [here](static/demo.mp4)

## Interactive Demonstration

If you'd like to try out the app yourself, please follow the instructions below depending on your device.

### Android

If you're using an Android device, you can download and install the app right on your device!  
Simply download the apk file [here](static/app.apk) and install it by selecting it in your device's file manager.

*NOTE*: You may not be able to install the app if your device has disabled installing apps from unknown sources. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK_jgnEe_8w) shows how you can install the app if this is the case for you.

### iOS

If you're on an iOS device (iPhone or iPad), you'll need to install the *Expo Go* app from the App Store before you can demo the application. You can find the app [here](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/expo-go/id982107779).  
Once you've installed the app, open up your device's camera app and scan the QR code at the bottom of this page. The app should automatically be downloaded and open up once it's done loading.

*NOTE*: When many people are connected to Expo at a time, it can sometimes result in the server crashing. This is because Expo isn't designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections. If this happens to you, just wait some time and re-scan the QR code. If this still fails, feel free to check out the [pre-recorded demonstration](static/demo.mp4)
